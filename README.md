# BlazorDesktopWPF

Modified the BlazorDesktopWPF Sample
https://github.com/jorgearteiro/BlazorDesktopWPF

Added a combination of WPF Elements and a BlazorWebView and then Set Tabstops for the controls and the BlazorWebView

Should showcase the tab stops do not work yet.

Also showcases that drop dows over the browser control work.
